# Student Exam Result Analysis Project

This project focuses on analyzing student exam results using Excel for data visualization and Python for data processing and automation. The goal is to identify performance trends and provide insights that help improve educational outcomes.

## Features
- **Data Analysis**: Analyze exam results to identify trends in student performance.
- **Automated Data Processing**: Python scripts used to clean and process raw student data, minimizing errors.
- **Visualization**: Excel dashboards to visualize student performance across different subjects.
  
## Technologies Used
- **Excel**: For data visualization and analysis.
- **Python**: For data cleaning, processing, and automation (libraries used: `pandas`, `matplotlib`).

## Project Setup
### Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Excel
- Install required Python libraries:
    ```bash
    pip install pandas matplotlib openpyxl
    ```

## Project Steps
1. **Data Collection**: Gathered exam data of students in Excel format.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Used Python `pandas` library to clean and preprocess the data.
3. **Data Analysis**: Performed subject-wise analysis using Python and visualized trends with Excel charts.
4. **Visualization**: Created interactive Excel dashboards to visualize exam trends and insights.

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/SiddhartNema/student-exam-result-analysis.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd student-exam-result-analysis
    ```
3. Run the Python script to clean and process the data:
    ```bash
    python exam_analysis.py
    ```

4. Open the Excel file to view the data visualizations.

## Conclusion
This project provides educators with clear, actionable insights from student exam data, helping to improve learning outcomes by identifying key areas of improvement for students.
